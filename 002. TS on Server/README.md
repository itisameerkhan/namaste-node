## ⭐ What is server?

A server is a powerful computer or software system that provides services, data, or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers can host websites, manage email, store files, run applications, and perform many other functions that support the operations of businesses and organizations. They are designed to handle multiple requests simultaneously, ensuring that the clients they serve can access the necessary data or services efficiently and reliably. In essence, servers are the backbone of the internet and many local networks, facilitating communication and resource sharing among various devices.

## ⭐ NodeJS is C++ code?

Yes, Node.js contains C++ code. While Node.js itself is primarily written in JavaScript, it uses C++ to interact with lower-level system resources and perform high-performance tasks. Specifically, Node.js relies on the **V8 JavaScript engine, developed by Google, which is written in C++** and responsible for executing JavaScript code.

## ⭐ V8 Javascript Engine 

V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, **written in C++**. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, or ARM processors. **V8 can be embedded into any C++ application.**

> [!NOTE]
> V8 Engine executes the JS code to machine code.
