# Microservices VS Monolith - How to Build a project

![demo](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62fcfcf2e1a4c21ed18b80e6/64f89fc4ee4e196209bff692_waterfall_in_project_management_oyws.png)

## üåä What is the Waterfall Model?

The **Waterfall Model** is a **sequential software development approach** where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Think of it like water flowing down steps ‚Äî once it moves forward, it doesn‚Äôt go back up easily.

It‚Äôs one of the **oldest SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) models**, mostly used when requirements are **clear, fixed, and unlikely to change**.

## üîë Phases of the Waterfall Model

1. **Requirements**

   * Collect and document what the customer wants.
   * No coding yet ‚Äî just analysis.
   * Example: Decide features, target users, constraints.

2. **Design**

   * Convert requirements into a **system design**.
   * Includes database design, system architecture, and UI/UX planning.
   * Acts like a blueprint before building.

3. **Implementation (Development)**

   * Actual coding starts.
   * Developers build modules based on the design documents.

4. **Verification (Testing)**

   * QA team tests the product to ensure it meets requirements.
   * Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing.

5. **Maintenance**

   * After delivery, real-world issues come up (bugs, upgrades, improvements).
   * Fixes and updates are done here.

| Aspect             | Monolithic üèóÔ∏è             | Microservices üîó                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Codebase**       | One large unified codebase | Many small, independent codebases |
| **Deployment**     | Single unit                | Independent deployments           |
| **Scaling**        | Entire app                 | Specific services                 |
| **Tech stack**     | Usually one                | Multiple possible                 |
| **Failure impact** | Whole app can crash        | Only one service fails            |
| **Best for**       | Small/medium apps, MVPs    | Large, complex, scalable systems  |

## MONOLITH VS MICROSERVICES


| **Aspect**          | **Monolith**                                                                         | **Microservices**                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dev Speed**       | Faster in the beginning since everything is in one codebase.                         | Slower initially due to setup overhead (APIs, infra, services), but scales better for large teams. |
| **Code Repo**       | Single code repository, easy to manage for small projects.                           | Multiple repos (or monorepo with separate services), more organization needed.                     |
| **Scalability**     | Entire app scales together, not flexible (can overuse resources).                    | Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.                                   |
| **Deployment**      | One deployment for the whole app; simple but risky (small bug can break everything). | Independent deployments for each service, safer but more complex (CI/CD pipelines needed).         |
| **Tech Stack**      | Usually restricted to one stack across the whole app.                                | Each service can use its own tech stack (polyglot flexibility).                                    |
| **Infra Cost**      | Cheaper infra at small scale, but less efficient at larger scale.                    | Higher infra cost (containers, service mesh, monitoring), but cost-efficient at scale.             |
| **Complexity**      | Lower complexity for small projects, but becomes unmanageable as app grows.          | Higher complexity from day one (network, APIs, distributed systems).                               |
| **Fault Isolation** | A bug/crash can affect the entire system.                                            | Failures isolated to specific services, rest of system remains functional.                         |
| **Testing**         | Easier for small apps (unit + integration in one place).                             | Requires contract testing, integration across services, harder setup.                              |
| **Ownership**       | One team owns entire codebase, harder to scale team-wise.                            | Each service can be owned by separate team (clear boundaries, autonomy).                           |
| **Maintenance**     | Harder as codebase grows (tight coupling, spaghetti code risk).                      | Easier long-term since services are smaller and loosely coupled.                                   |
| **Revamps**         | Refactoring requires touching large parts of system.                                 | Can revamp/rewrite one service without affecting others.                                           |
| **Debugging**       | Easier locally (single process, logs in one place).                                  | Harder (distributed logs, tracing, network latency issues).                                        |
| **Dev Experience**  | Simple setup, faster onboarding for small teams.                                     | Requires knowledge of CI/CD, containers, service communication, monitoring.                        |
