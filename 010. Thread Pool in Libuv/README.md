# Thread Pool in Libuv 

There are extra 2 phases in the event loop cycle 

1.  pending callbacks 

2.  idle, prepare 

---

## ‚≠ê Phases Overview

1. **timers**: this phase executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.

2. **pending callbacks**: executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.

3. **idle, prepare**: only used internally.

4. **poll**: retrieve new I/O events; execute I/O related callbacks (almost all with the exception of close callbacks, the ones scheduled by timers, and `setImmediate()`); node will block here when appropriate.

5. **check**: `setImmediate()` callbacks are invoked here.
6. **close callbacks**: some close callbacks, e.g. `socket.on('close', ...)`.
