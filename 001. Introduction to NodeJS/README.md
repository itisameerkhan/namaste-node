## History of NodeJS 

## ðŸ“… 2009 

* **Ryan Dahl**  released his project, the **Node.js** runtime.

* NodeJS uses **Spider Monkey** (Firefox) Javascript Engine.

* In just 2 days, He refused to use Spider Monkey Engine

* Moved to **V8 Engine** (Google Chrome)

* **Joyent** recognized the potential of Node.js and hired **Dahl** to continue its development and promotion. By providing financial support and resources, **Joyent** helped accelerate the growth and adoption of Node.js. The company also used Node.js in its own platform to enhance its offerings.

* NodeJS initial name was **WebJS** for creating Web servers. He realized its potential that it cannot only be used for builting Web servers you can build anything out of it. He renamed it to **NodeJS**.

* Dahl criticized the limited capability of **Apache HTTP Server**, that Apache Server is a "Blocking Server", so he wants to create **Non-Blocking Server** was the issue that he wanted to fix.

* The Advantage of **Non-Blocking Server** it can handle multiple requests with lesser number of threads.


## ðŸ“… 2010

* **NPM** (Node Package Manager) released.

* NPM is registry, in that you can add package for NodeJS

* Developer from **Joyent** has developed.

* NodeJS would not be successfull if without NPM

## ðŸ“… 2011

* Windows Support. Initially NodeJS was build for MacOS and Linux.

* Joyent and Microsoft collaborate and created Windows support for community.

## ðŸ“… 2012

* Ryan Dahl was decided to step down from the project.

* Dahl handed over the maintenance of Node.js to **Isaac Z. Schlueter**, who had been an active contributor to the project.

* **Issac** creator of NPM.

* Node.js community faced a significant challenge related to the V8 JavaScript engine used by Node.js. At the time, Google Chrome, which also relied on the V8 engine, was regularly receiving updates to improve its performance and capabilities. However, Node.js could not capture these updates as quickly due to several reasons, primarily related to stability and compatibility concerns.

## ðŸ“… 2014

* Joyent, the company managing Node.js, was seen by some as holding back the project by releasing updates slowly and not fully welcoming the open-source community's input. This made it hard for developers to get new features and improvements quickly, which frustrated many and hindered the project's growth.

* In December 2014, **Fedor Indutny**, a prominent contributor to Node.js, created a fork of the project called **io.js**. The fork was intended to allow for more rapid development and to better incorporate the contributions and feedback from the community.

## ðŸ“… 2015

* In 2015, the Node.js and io.js communities, which had been divided over issues related to development speed and governance, decided to **merge their efforts**. 

* The **Node.js Foundation** was set up in 2015 to fix problems with how Node.js was managed. It was created to make sure the project was run openly and fairly, with input from the whole community. The goal was to speed up updates, encourage more people to get involved, and make sure Node.js could keep growing and improving over time. 

## ðŸ“… 2019

* **Node.js Foundation** and the **JS Foundation** merged to form the **OpenJS Foundation**.

* **OpenJS Foundation** took control over NodeJS.
